To solve this problem with programming, we use the Python Scipy package, which provides fundamental algorithms for scientific computing in Python. Specifically, we use the minimize function provided by this package, whose documentation can be found at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.minimize.html\n",
